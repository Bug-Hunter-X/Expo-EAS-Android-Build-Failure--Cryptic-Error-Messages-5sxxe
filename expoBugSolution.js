The solution to this type of problem often involves a multi-step debugging process:

1. **Check EAS Build Logs:** The most important step is thoroughly reviewing the complete build logs provided by the EAS build service. These logs often contain more detailed error messages hidden within the general output. Search for specific error codes, stack traces, or warnings that might provide hints about the root cause.
2. **Simplify the App:** If the logs are still unclear, try to create a minimal reproducible example. Remove non-essential components and dependencies from your app until you identify the minimum set of code that causes the build to fail. This isolated example can simplify debugging.
3. **Dependency Management:** Review your `package.json`. Ensure your dependencies are compatible and up-to-date.  Check if there are any known issues with specific libraries you're using related to Android builds. Consider running `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to detect security vulnerabilities or outdated packages.
4. **Check Android Configuration:** If you have custom Android configurations (e.g., Gradle files), carefully review them for syntax errors or inconsistencies. Verify that paths, configurations, and dependencies are set up correctly and that there are no conflicting settings.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple clean and rebuild of the project can resolve transient issues. Try deleting the `node_modules` folder, and re-installing your dependencies.  Also try running a clean build command within your Android Studio project (if you're using Android Studio alongside EAS).
6. **Expo SDK and CLI Versions:**  Make sure you are using a recent and supported version of the Expo SDK and CLI.  Outdated versions can sometimes have build compatibility problems.
7. **Community Support:** If the problem persists, consult the Expo community forums or support channels. Providing the detailed build logs can greatly assist in diagnosing the issue.
