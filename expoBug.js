This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `eas build` command.  The build process fails, and the error message might be vague or point to an internal issue within the Expo build system. The exact error message might vary, but it typically doesn't give clear indication of the root cause. For example, you might see generic messages like "Build failed" or errors related to the Android build system without pinpointing the source within your application code.
