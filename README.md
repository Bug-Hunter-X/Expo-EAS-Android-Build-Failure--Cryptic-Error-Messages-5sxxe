# Expo EAS Android Build Failure: Cryptic Error Messages

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo EAS Android build process fails with unclear error messages. The build process terminates without providing specific details about the cause of the failure, making debugging challenging.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the instructions in `expoBug.js` to set up the project.
3. Attempt to build the Android app using `eas build --platform android`. Note the cryptic error message.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `expoBugSolution.js`. This often involves carefully reviewing the full build logs (often available via the EAS console), searching for more specific error messages buried within the output, and potentially checking Android build configurations for issues.  In some cases, upgrading Expo SDK versions or dependencies may resolve the problem, as might verifying that all necessary Android build tools and configurations are correct.
